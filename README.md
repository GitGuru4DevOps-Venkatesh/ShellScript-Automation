**Automate Git and GitHub Tasks with a Simple Shell Script  Step-by-Step Tutorial**

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1: Introduction

"Hello, everyone! Welcome back. Today, we have a practical tutorial where we'll be automating some common Git and GitHub tasks using a simple shell script. Let's dive in!"

***Basic shell script commands along with examples that you can use to explain during your training session:***

To effectively start training on basic shell scripting, you'll want to break down the content into logical sections and explain each concept with practical examples. Here's a suggested structure and content you can use:

### 1. **Introduction to Shell Scripting**
   - **What is Shell Scripting?**
     - Explain that shell scripting is a way to automate tasks by writing a series of commands in a file, which the shell interprets and executes.
     - Mention common shells like `bash`, `sh`, `zsh`, and the environments they are used in (Linux, macOS, etc.).

   - **Why Learn Shell Scripting?**
     - Discuss the benefits: automating repetitive tasks, managing system operations, batch processing, and simplifying complex commands.

### 2. **Basic Shell Script Structure**
   - **Shebang (`#!`)**
     - Explain that `#!/bin/bash` at the top of the script tells the system which interpreter to use.
     - Example:
       ```bash
       #!/bin/bash
       echo "This is a shell script."
       ```

   - **Comments (`#`)**
     - Explain the importance of commenting your code for readability and maintenance.
     - Example:
       ```bash
       # This is a comment
       echo "Comments are ignored by the shell."
       ```

### 3. **Basic Commands and Syntax**
   - **Echoing Text**
     - Introduce the `echo` command for printing text to the terminal.
     - Example:
       ```bash
       echo "Hello, World!"
       ```

   - **Variables**
     - Explain how to create and use variables.
     - Example:
       ```bash
       name="Venkatesh"
       echo "Hello, $name!"
       ```

   - **Reading User Input**
     - Teach how to capture input using `read`.
     - Example:
       ```bash
       read -p "Enter your name: " name
       echo "Hello, $name!"
       ```

### 4. **Conditional Statements**
   - **If-Else Statements**
     - Introduce `if-else` for decision-making.
     - Example:
       ```bash
       if [ $name == "Venkatesh" ]; then
           echo "Welcome, Venkatesh!"
       else
           echo "Hello, Stranger!"
       fi
       ```

   - **Case Statements**
     - Show how to handle multiple conditions with `case`.
     - Example:
       ```bash
       read -p "Enter a number between 1 and 3: " number
       case $number in
           1) echo "You chose one." ;;
           2) echo "You chose two." ;;
           3) echo "You chose three." ;;
           *) echo "Invalid choice." ;;
       esac
       ```

### 5. **Loops**
   - **For Loops**
     - Explain how to repeat tasks using `for`.
     - Example:
       ```bash
       for i in 1 2 3 4 5
       do
           echo "Iteration $i"
       done
       ```

   - **While Loops**
     - Demonstrate continuous looping with `while`.
     - Example:
       ```bash
       counter=1
       while [ $counter -le 5 ]
       do
           echo "Counter is $counter"
           ((counter++))
       done
       ```

   - **Until Loops**
     - Explain looping until a condition is met.
     - Example:
       ```bash
       counter=1
       until [ $counter -gt 5 ]
       do
           echo "Counter is $counter"
           ((counter++))
       done
       ```

### 6. **Functions**
   - **Creating and Using Functions**
     - Teach how to create reusable code blocks with functions.

These additional commands cover a wide array of advanced operations and will help your trainees build a robust foundation in shell scripting.

These additional commands will provide with a comprehensive understanding of shell scripting, covering essential operations in file management, text processing, system monitoring, and more.

These commands and examples cover a wide range of basic shell scripting concepts. You can build on these examples by explaining how they can be combined to create more complex scripts.

Step 2: Overview of the Shell Script

"Alright, let's take a quick look at the script. This shell script automates the process of cloning source code from an existing GitHub repository, creating a new repository on GitHub, and copying the source code into the new repository. Let's break it down."

Step 3: Explanation of Variables

"Firstly, we have these variables. You'll need to replace yourusername, source-repo, new-repo, and YourAccessToken with your GitHub username, repository names, and a valid GitHub access token, respectively."

Step 4: Demonstrating Cloning Source Code

"Now, let's kick things off by cloning the source code from our existing repository. The git clone command is used for this purpose. Make sure to replace the URL with your actual repository URL."

Step 5: Demonstrating Creating a New Repository

"Next up, we'll use the GitHub API to create a new repository. This involves sending a curl request with your GitHub access token. Ensure that your token has the necessary permissions."

Step 6: Demonstrating Cloning the Newly Created Repository

"With the new repository created, we'll clone it using the familiar git clone command. Copy the URL from your newly created repository on GitHub and replace it in the script."

Step 7: Demonstrating Copying Source Code

"Now comes the part where we copy the source code from the original repository to the new one. Simple cp commands do the trick."

Step 8: Demonstrating Committing and Pushing Changes

"Time to commit and push our changes. The usual Git commands come into play here: git add ., git commit, and git push. Make sure to replace main if you're using a different branch."

Step 9: Conclusion

"And there you have it! We've successfully automated the process of cloning, creating, and uploading source code using a simple shell script. Feel free to customize it based on your needs. If you found this helpful, don't forget to like, share, and subscribe for more content."

Step 10: Q&A and Troubleshooting

"Now, If you encounter any issues, let's troubleshoot them together."

**"Thank you so much for joining me today. I hope you found this tutorial valuable. Remember, the script and additional resources are in the description below. Until next time, happy coding!"**

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Create a shell script to automate these steps. Below is an example of a simple shell script that combines the described steps. Save this script with a `.sh` extension, and make it executable using the `chmod +x script_name.sh` command or use this one also chmod 777 script_name.sh` command. Then, you can run it using `./script_name.sh`.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Set your repository URLs
source_repo_url="https://github.com/repositoryname/source-repo.git"
new_repo_url="https://github.com/repositoryname/new-repo.git"

# Clone source code from GitHub to local
git clone "$source_repo_url"

# Create a new repository on GitHub
# (You may need to replace 'YourAccessToken' with a valid GitHub access token)
curl -u "YourAccessToken:x-oauth-basic" https://api.github.com/user/repos -d '{"name":"new-repo"}'

# Clone the newly created repository
git clone "$new_repo_url"

# Switch to the previously cloned repository
cd source-repo

# Copy source code to the newly created repository
cp -r ./* ../new-repo

# Switch to the new repository
cd ../new-repo

# Commit and push changes
git add .
git commit -m "Copy source code from source-repo"
git push origin main

echo "Script executed successfully!"
```

Note:

Must and should please replace `yourusername`, `source-repo`, `new-repo`, and `YourAccessToken` with your GitHub username, repository names, and a valid GitHub access token.
Make sure to replace `main` with the appropriate branch name if you're using a different branch.
